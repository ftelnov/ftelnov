- 👋 Hi, I’m @ftelnov
- 👀 I’m interested in complex and challenging problems, mostly related to backend-side. 
- 🌱 I’m currently enhancing my UNIX and Rust knowledge.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any complex system. The harder requirements are for backend parts, the more interesting system is for me!
- 📫 How to reach me - @ftelnov (Telegram) / ftelnov@protonmail.com (email).
