- 👋 Hi, I’m @ftelnov
- 👀 I’m interested in web-development - both frontend and backend parts, but backend is prefered!
- 🌱 I’m currently enhancing Rust knowledge by building various microservices with it.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any complex system. The harder requirements are for backend parts, the more interesting system is for me!
- 📫 How to reach me - @lasomb (Telegram) / ftelnov@protonmail.com (email).
